    <h3 style="text-align:left">How I created this site</h4>
    <p>
      My main source of motivation was a free Codecademy course on Bootstrap.</br>
      Every detail (except for the fonts) was either drawn by me or pieced together by me.</br>
      There's a lot of filler content for the lols and giggles.</br>
      W3 Schools guided me in adding extra details and Javascript.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align:left">What is this site about?</h4>
    <p>
      Before you message me about what this website is about, I hope you read this. </br>
      I'm just learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap right now.</br>
      I'm not making this for a special purpose other than to test features and get a feel for web development.
